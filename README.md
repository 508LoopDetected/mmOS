# mmOS

Here's my attempt to emulate a classic desktop environment from scratch with SvelteKit! This is just a fun time-killer to occasionally play with between other more worthwhile projects. Visually speaking, I'm 100% making it up as I go, but my heart ultimately lies in that late 90s / early 00s era of skeuomorphic goodness: GNOME 2, Mac OS 8, KDE 2/3, etc.

### Added so far...
- Bare-bones Window Mgmt with resize, maximize, open/close, focusing, dragging, etc.
- That vintage Linux drip

### Coming next, maybe...
- Dock-like Taskbar
- Basic "file browser" (preset components)
