# mmOS

Not _really_ an operating system, but let's see how far I can get from scratch with SvelteKit! This is just a fun time-killer to occasionally play with between other more worthwhile projects. I'm 100% making it up as I go.

### Added so far...
- Bare-bones Window Mgmt with resize, maximize, open/close, focusing, dragging, etc.
- That late 90s / early 00s Linux drip

### Coming next, maybe...
- Dock-like Taskbar
- Basic "file browser" (preset components)
