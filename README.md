# skOS

skOS attempts to emulate a classic desktop environment from scratch using SvelteKit. This is just a fun time-killer to occasionally play with between other more worthwhile projects. Visually speaking, it's 100% made up as it goes along, but ultimately inspired by that late 90s / early 00s era of skeuomorphic goodness: GNOME 2, Mac OS 9, CDE, KDE 2, etc.

### Added so far...
- Window management with resize, maximize, open/close, focusing, dragging, etc.
- That vintage Linux drip with basic color schemes
- Desktop shortcuts
- DOOM (via js-dos)
- Terminal emulator (proof of concept)

### Coming next, maybe...
- Dock-like Taskbar
- Basic "file browser" + database
- App Library / Package Manager (preset components)
- User accounts / personalized settings
- Holy refactoring, Batman!
